## Task 1
1. Given the review text and other information about it, you have to predict the rating associated with that review.
2. This is a classification problem. Rating 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are the classes. The metric to be used for leader board is weighted F1 score.
3. Analyze the text data and perform appropriate preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, or stemming/lemmatization.
4. You can create features using basic techniques like bag of words or TF-IDF.
5. This is a multi-class classification problem. The class distribution might be skewed towards higher ratings (1 star ratings are always rare)
6. Save your preprocessed data and read about saving models with pickle.


## Task 2
1. You have to build a neural network using Numpy. So you CANNOT use TensorFlow, PyTorch or any other library with built-in neural networks
2. It is a regression task. You have to predict the ’Price’ of the house.
